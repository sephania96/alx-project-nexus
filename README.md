Poll System Backend
Project Overview
This project is a robust and scalable backend for an online poll system, built using Django and Django REST Framework. It leverages PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and provides comprehensive API documentation through Swagger UI. The system is designed to handle poll creation, user voting, and real-time result computation, with a focus on performance and ease of use.

Key Features:
Poll Management:
APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting polls.
Each poll includes a title, description, creation date, and an optional expiry date.
Option to allow or disallow multiple votes per user per poll.
Voting System:
Secure APIs for authenticated users to cast votes on poll options.
Built-in validation to prevent duplicate voting (unless explicitly allowed by the poll settings).
Checks for active and unexpired polls before allowing votes.
Real-time Result Computation:
Efficiently calculates and displays vote counts and percentages for each option in real-time.
Optimized database queries for scalability, ensuring quick access to results even with many votes.
API Documentation:
Interactive API documentation powered by Swagger UI, accessible at /api/docs/.
Provides clear descriptions of all endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods.
PostgreSQL Database:
Utilizes PostgreSQL for its reliability, performance, and advanced features, making it suitable for production environments.
Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Django 4.2.7
API Framework: Django REST Framework 3.14.0
Database: PostgreSQL
API Documentation: drf-yasg (Swagger/OpenAPI)
Environment Variables: python-decouple
CORS Handling: django-cors-headers
Web Server (Production): Gunicorn



## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.
- Serve as a reference guide for both current and future learners.
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

## Overview of the ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The ProDev Backend Engineering program is an intensive curriculum designed to equip learners with core backend development skills. It emphasizes real-world projects, industry best practices, and collaboration among peers.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered

- **Python**: Core programming language used for backend services.
- **Django**: Web framework for rapid backend development.
- **REST APIs**: Designing and implementing RESTful services.
- **GraphQL**: Alternative to REST for flexible client-server interactions.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD**: Automation pipelines for testing, integration, and deployment.

### Important Backend Development Concepts

- **Database Design**: Schema design, normalization, indexing, and relationships.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Using async/await for non-blocking operations.
- **Caching Strategies**: Techniques to optimize performance with tools like Redis.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Challenge**: Managing API versioning in production systems.
  - **Solution**: Implemented versioned URLs and used documentation for smooth upgrades.

- **Challenge**: Integrating CI/CD in legacy systems.
  - **Solution**: Gradual migration using GitHub Actions and Docker.

- **Challenge**: Efficiently handling background tasks.
  - **Solution**: Integrated Celery with RabbitMQ for scalable task queues.

## Best Practices & Takeaways

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Use environment variables and secrets management.
- Write unit and integration tests early in the development cycle.
- Communicate effectively with team members (especially frontend engineers).
- Document APIs thoroughly using Swagger/OpenAPI.

## Collaboration Hub

Collaboration is key to success. Learners are encouraged to:

### Collaborate With

- **Fellow ProDev Frontend Learners**: Exchange ideas, build cohesive systems, and maximize collective output.
- **ProDev Backend Learners**: Work together to solve problems and share knowledge.

### Where to Collaborate

- **Discord Channel**: `#ProDevProjectNexus`
  - Connect with both Frontend and Backend learners.
  - Share ideas, ask questions, and get updates from staff.

ðŸ’¡ **ProDev Tip!**

- Use the first week to communicate your project.
- Identify frontend collaborators early for smooth integration.
